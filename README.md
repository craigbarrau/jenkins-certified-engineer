    - unit. specific functionality testing, individual classes, methods etc.
    - smoke. aka sanity testing. testing the general functionality as a whole (came from mechanical engineering, "does the car go?", if not machine starts to smoke)
    - integration. multiple modules/pieces coming together and have expected functionality
    - acceptance. business requirement(s) testing

## Jenkins usage (features and functionality)

- Jobs
  - Organizing jobs in Jenkins
    - Folders
      - One way to manage projects
      - New item - Folder
        - Name
        - Display name
        - Description
        - Health metrics - Items in nested sub-folders are used to calculate the folder's health
        - Properties
        - Pipeline libraries
        - Pipeline model definition
      - "Jenkins" path is the root folder of the projects, you can move existing projects to the newly created folder (click project properties - "Move")
      - You can have nested folders
    - Views
      - The global view is the same for all of the users
      - On the default view, after clicking on the "+" tab on the main screen, we see
        - View name
        - List View - simple list format (choosing this will take you directly to the configuration page)
        - My View - automatically displays all the jobs that the current user has an access to
      - After that, you can "Edit View" on the left side
        - Name
        - Description
        - Filter build queue
        - Filter build executors
      - Job filters
        - Status filter - all selected, enabled jobs only, disabled jobs only
        - Recurse in subfolders [] - you will see all jobs in all folders below
        - Jobs [] TOP LEVEL FOLDER
        - Use regular expression to include jobs into the view: `.*Downstream.*``
      - Add Job Filter
        - Columns
          - Status
          - Weather
          - Name
          - Last success
          - Last failure
          - Last duration
          - Build button
      - Manage Jenkins - Configure system - Default view
        - You can specify own set of per-user views in "My Views"

    - Types of parameters
      - Boolean parameter
      - Choice parameter
      - Credentials parameter
      - File parameter
      - List subversion tags (and more)
      - Multi-line string parameter
      - Password parameter - not protected from showing up in the build log (!)
      - Run parameter (jobname, jobname.number, jobname_NAME, jobname_RESULT, jobname_JOBNAME, jobname_NUMBER...)
      - String parameter
    - How to pass parameters between the upstream/downstream:
      - Plugins - "Parameterized Trigger plugin"
      - Downstream project - must be parameterized - e.g. String parameter `$IMPORTANT_PARAM`
      - Upstream project - Add build step - Trigger/call build on other projects - Downstream project - Add predefined parameters `IMPORTANT_PARAM=$BUILD_NUMBER`

- Security
  - Setting up and using security realms
  - User database, project security, Matrix security
  - Setting up and using auditing
  - Setting up and using credentials
- Fingerprints
  - Fingerprinting jobs shared or copied between jobs
    - Add 'post' directive to the Jenkinsfile:
    ```
    post {
      always {   <-- this can be also 'success'
        archive '<DIR>/*.jar'
      }
    }
    ```
    - When you click on the build #, you will see a new column "Build Artifacts"
    - If you want better tracking of artifacts (the additional option "See Fingerprints" on the left in each build)
      ```
      post {
        always {
          archiveArtifacts artifacts: '<DIR>/*.jar', fingerprint: true
        }
      }
      ```
    - Everything lands on the master inside `$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/<JOB_NAME>/builds/<BUILD_NUMBER>/archive/<DIR>/*.jar`
- Artifacts
  - Copying artifacts
    - Install new plugin 'Copy Artifact Plugin', we can set permissions between projects to allow artifacts copying
      - [X]Permission to Copy Artifacts:
      - New build step:
        - Copy artifacts from another project:
          - Project name:
          - Which build: Latest successful build/Latest saved build/Upstream/Downstream/Last completed (ignoring status)/Specific etc etc.
          - Artifacts to copy: `<DIR>/rectangle.jar`
          - Artifacts not to copy
          - Target directory
          - [X]Fingerprint artifacts
  - Using artifacts in Jenkins
    - When you go to the "Workspace" in the project, you will see the artifact(s)
  - Artifact retention policy
    - Retention policy can be set up in Jenkinsfile:
    ```
    options {
      buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '2', artifactNumToKeepStr: '1'))
    }
    ```
    - In the console this is called "Discard old builds", click Advanced and also post-build action: "Archive the artifacts"
      - File to archive: ``<DIR>/rectangle.jar"``
- Alerts
  - Making basic updates to jobs and build scripts
  - Troubleshooting specific problems from build and test failure alerts

  - Upstream and downstream
    - Triggering jobs from other jobs
    - Setting up the Parameterized Trigger plugin
    - Upstream/downstreamjobs
  - Triggering
    - Triggering Jenkins on code changes
      - Trigger builds remotely (e.g. from scripts)
      - Build manually
      - Build after other projects are built
      - Build periodically - cron format
      - GitHub hook trigger for GIT
        - Add Githook functionality (Github - Project - Settings - Integration & Services - Jenkins hook url)
        - Add new item in Jenkins UI - Pipeline - My Java Projects
          - [X]Github project
          - [X]GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
          - Pipeline
            - Definition: Pipeline script from SCM
            - SCM: Git
              - Repository URL
              - Credentials
            - Branches to build
              - Branch Specifier (blank for 'any'): `*/development`
            - Repoitory browser: githubweb
              - URL: <PROJECT URL>
            - Script path: `Jenkinsfile`
      - Scm polling
    - Difference between push and pull
    - When to use push vs. pull
  - Pipeline (formerly known as “Workflow”)
    - Benefits of Pipeline vs linked jobs
    - Functionalities offered by Pipeline
      - `Jenkinsfile` lives in the SCM that defines the Jenkins pipeline
      - needs pipeline plugin
      - 2 styles:
        - Declarative - defining the state as oppose to scripted
        - Scripted - more like a bash script, Groovy programing style
      - Example - basic layout:
      ```
      pipeline {
        agent any   <- which agent are we going to use for this pipeline (any/none/label '<MATCH>'/docker '<IMAGE>')

        stages {   <- stages of build
          stage('Build') {
            steps {
              echo 'Buidling..'
            }
          }
          stage('Test') {
            steps {
              echo 'Testing..'
            }
          }
          stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
              echo 'Deploying..'
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```
      - directives can be either on the top and it applies to all steps, or in each step explicitly (e.g. different docker image for test and for deploy)
      - tons of different "steps" associated with plugins
      - "sh" for a shell script is the most commonly used
      - "echo" prints a string
      - environment directive sets EVN vars and they are available from the scope where they are defined:
      ```
      environment {
        ENV_VAR = "my value"
      }
      ```

  - Pipeline [Multibranch](https://jenkins.io/blog/2015/12/03/pipeline-as-code-with-multibranch-workflows-in-jenkins/) and Repository Scanning
    - Usage of Multibranch jobs
      - [Example for Java Project](https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-jenkins-java-project/blob/master/Jenkinsfile)
      - You can have conditions in the Jenkinsfile:
        ```when {
          branch 'development'
        }
        ```
      - When we have trunk branch where everyone pushes the code and then when tests are fine we want to promote to a different branch - we need to select "Multibranch pipeline"
        - Name
        - Display name
        - Description
        - Branch Sources
          - Add source - Git   <--not GitHub, because it uses HTTPS
            - Project repository: git@...
            - Credentials: jenkins
            - Repository browser: githubweb
              - URL: https://...
            - Additional Behaviours
            - Advanced:
              - Include branches
              - Exclude branches
              - Property strategy - All branches get the same properties
        - Health Metrics
          - [X]Recursive - individual projects will dictate the health
        - Pipeline Libraries
        - Pipeline Model Definition
      - After you save, it is determining the available branches
      - Disable the previous pipeline        
      - Add a new stage "Promote Development to Master"
      ```
        agent {
          label 'apache'
        }
        when {
          branch 'development'
        }
        steps {
          sh 'git stash'   <--stashing any local changes
          sh 'git checkout development'
          sh 'git pull origin'
          sh 'git checkout master'
          sh 'git merge development'
          sh 'git push origin master'
        }
        ```
      - Change "when branch development" to "master"
      - ENV var called ${env.BRANCH_NAME} is only available in multibranch pipeline project
      - Use this ENV var to create subdirectories where artifacts will be stored (../rectangles/all/development etc.)
      - Use "Scan Multibranch Pipeline" on the left pane
      - Fully automated merge will be triggered after the development build is finished
    - Scanning GitHub and Bitbucket Organization
    - Scanning basic SCM repositories
  - Pipeline Global Libraries
    - How to share code across Pipelines
      - library that has methods accessible amongst different projects
      - extend the functionality of your pipeline
      - Groovy/pipeline syntax
      - Put a file "sayHello.groovy" inside jenkins-global-library/vars
      ```
      def call(String name = 'you') {
        echo "Hello, ${name}"
      }
      ```
      - To add it on the global level - Manage Jenkins - Configure System - Global Pipeline Libraries - Add
        - Name
        - Default version: master
        - Load implicitly [X]
        - Allow default version to be overriden [X]
        - Retrieval method
          - Modern SCM
            - [X]GitHub
              - Owner
              - Scan credentials
               - Repository: jenkins-global-library
      - Modify Jenkinsfile to invoke it
        ```
        stage('Say Hello') {
          agent any
          steps {
            sayHello 'Lucian Maly'
          }
        }
        ```
      - We can add it per specific project as well (!)
      - Scripted pipeline is more flexible
        ```
        call library
          script {

## CD-as-Code Best Practices

- [Distributed builds architecture](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds)
- [Fungible (replaceable) agents](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/hardware-recommendations/#choosing-the-right-build-machines)
- Master-agent connectors and protocol
  - Option 1: Master initiated to Agent over SSH.
  - Option 2: Agent initiated to Master over JNLP.
    In this case Master does not need network access to the Agent.

## Appendix

Ways to visualise items
- [Paramaterized Trigger Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/parameterized-trigger) + [Conditional Build Step](https://plugins.jenkins.io/conditional-buildstep). Powerful. Hard to configure. No longer needed when using Jenkinsfile (Pipeline).
- [Build Pipeline Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-pipeline-plugin). A Jenkin View visualising connected jobs. Also, allows integrated manual steps. Again, not really needed when using Jenkinsfile (Pipeline).
- [Pipeline Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator). Aka Jenkinsfile. Define relationships between steps in a DSL

Cool plugins
- [Jenkins Literate Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/literate). Write jobs in Markdown
- [Timestamper Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/timestamper). Find out when something happened by logging time against each log record.
